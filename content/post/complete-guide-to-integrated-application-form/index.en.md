Welcome to Korea! 🎉

Besides the visa, the first and most important task remains: **Alien Registration**.

If you plan to stay in Korea for more than 90 days, you must register as a captain at the appropriate country/foreigner registration office and obtain an approved **Alien Registration Card (ARC)** within 90 days of your arrival. Please note that exceptions to this period may apply.

Today, you can completely overcome the protection registration process and requirements, up to the latest 2026 standards.

## 1. Why do I need to register as an alien?

The alien registration card is your **identification card** in Korea. Without it, you cannot:

* Open a bank account and use online banking
* Open a mobile phone in your name
* Sign up for health insurance
* Free entry and exit (having a registration card makes re-entry easier)

## 2. 4-Step Application Process

1. **Reservation for Visit (HiKorea):** Do not simply visit the office. Be sure to first make a reservation on [HiKorea](https://www.hikorea.go.kr).
2. **Prepare Documents:** Carefully gather all the required documents described below.
3. **Visit and Registration:** Visit the immigration office with jurisdiction on the scheduled date. (Fingerprints will be registered and a facial photo will be taken.)
4. **Receipt of Registration Card:** You can pick up your registration card in person or receive it by registered mail approximately 2-4 weeks later.

## 3. Common Required Documents (Required for Everyone)

These are the basic documents required for all applicants, regardless of visa type.

### ✅ 2. One passport-size photo (Standard Photo)
* **Dimensions:** 3.5cm x 4.5cm, white background.
* **Note:** The photo must be taken within the last 6 months. Any excessively photoshopped photos may be rejected.

### ✅ 3. Integrated Application Form
* This is the Ministry of Justice Form No. 34.
* Be sure to accurately fill out your name, date of birth, home address, and Korean address.
* 📝 **Tip:** Is filling out the application form complicated? Anyone can easily and accurately create a PDF application using **[K-Visa Generator]**. (Service Link)

### ✅ 4. Proof of Residence
This is one of the most difficult documents to obtain. Please prepare the documents appropriate to your housing type.
* **Contracts in your name:** Original/copy of lease agreement
* **School dormitory:** Dormitory move-in confirmation
* **Gosiwon:** Move-in confirmation + copy of gosiwon business registration
* **Acquaintance/family home:** Residence/accommodation provision confirmation + copy of provider's ID (+ copy of real estate register, if necessary)

### ✅ 5. Fee

## 4. Additional Documents by Visa (Station Status)

Additional documents required vary depending on your visa type.

### 🎓 International Students (D-2, D-4)
* **Certificate of Enrollment** (or Standard Admission Permit)
* **Tuberculosis Screening Certificate** (Only for citizens of eligible countries: China, Vietnam, the Philippines, and other countries designated by the Ministry of Justice)

## 5. Application Filling Tips (How to Avoid Rejection)

* **Home Address in English:** For entry into the immigration system, it's recommended to enter your home address in **English** as accurately as possible.
* **Korean Phone Number:** If you haven't yet activated your account, leave this blank or enter the number of a contactable friend or school representative. You can update your number (report a change) after receiving your registration certificate and opening your account.
* **Name:** Be sure to spell your name exactly as it appears on your passport, including spacing.
