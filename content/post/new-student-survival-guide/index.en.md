Welcome to Korea! 🎉
Are you excited about delicious Tteokbokki, a beautiful campus, and making new friends?

But wait a second! ✋
To properly enjoy life in Korea, there are **5 administrative tasks you MUST complete** immediately after arrival. If you delay these, you won't be able to use a mobile phone, open a bank account, or even worse, you might face fines.

Here is the **most realistic checklist** on where to go, what to do, and how to do it.

---

## 1. Getting a SIM Card (Mobile Phone) 📱

In Korea, you can't do anything without a mobile phone number (Delivery apps, Identity verification, etc.).

* **When:** Immediately upon arrival (Airport) or after arriving in the city.
* **Where:**
    * **Incheon Airport:** There are roaming centers for major carriers (SKT, KT, LG U+) in the arrival hall. It's the fastest way, but the plans can be a bit pricey.
    * **Budget Phone (MVNO):** Look for agencies specializing in foreigners like 'Chingu Mobile' or 'Woori Mobile' in the city. Their plans for international students are much cheaper.
* **Important Note:**
    * Since you don't have an Alien Registration Card (ARC) yet, you must first activate a **Prepaid SIM** using your **Passport**.
    * Once you receive your ARC later, contact your carrier to switch to a **Postpaid** plan and apply for identity verification services.

## 2. Alien Registration (ARC) 🌟 *Most Important!*

If you haven't registered within 90 days of arriving in Korea, you will become an **illegal resident**.

* **When:** Within 90 days of arrival (But reservation slots fill up fast, so hurry!)
* **Where:** The **Immigration Office** that has jurisdiction over your residence.
* **What to submit:** **Integrated Application Form (Form No. 34)**, Passport, Photo, Certificate of Enrollment, Proof of Residence + Fingerprint registration.
* **💡 Realistic Tip:**
    * Many students get rejected because they make mistakes while handwriting the application form, such as mixing English/Korean or writing the wrong address format.
    * Use the **[K-Visa Form Generator](https://k-form.kr)**. Just enter your passport information, and it will create a **perfect application form (PDF)** ready for submission in 3 minutes. No need to worry about how to write your Korean address in English.

## 3. Proof of Residence 🏠

This is strictly required for Alien Registration and opening a bank account.

* **Dormitory Students:** Go to the Dormitory Office and ask for a **'Certificate of Residence'**.
* **Renters (One-room/Studio):** Keep the original **'Lease Agreement'** under your name safe.
* **Gosiwon:** Ask the Gosiwon owner for a 'Confirmation of Residence' and a copy of their 'Business Registration Certificate'.

---

## 4. Tuberculosis (TB) Test 🏥

This is a mandatory document when moving into a dormitory or changing your visa status.

* **Where:** A **Public Health Center (Bo-geon-so)** near your residence.
* **Cost:** University hospitals are expensive (20,000~30,000 KRW), but Public Health Centers are very cheap (**approx. 2,000~3,000 KRW**).
* **How:** Bring your passport to the nearest Public Health Center, say "I came for a TB Test (Gyeol-haek Geom-sa)," and get a chest X-ray. Results usually take 3~4 days.

---

## 5. Opening a Bank Account 💰

You need an account to receive allowance from your parents or use a debit card in Korea.

* **Where:** Go to a **bank located on your university campus (Woori, Shinhan, etc.)**. Banks affiliated with schools are the most helpful for international students.
* **What to bring:** Passport, Certificate of Enrollment, and your Alien Registration Card (if you have one).
* **Important Note:** Before you get your ARC, banks will only open a **'Limited Account'** for you (Daily withdrawal/transfer limit is restricted to 300,000 KRW ~ 1,000,000 KRW). Visit the bank again after you get your ARC to lift this limit.

## 📝 Summary: First Week Routine for Freshmen

1.  Activate a **Prepaid SIM** at the airport or in the city to get a phone number.
2.  Get your **Proof of Residence** from your dorm or real estate agent.
3.  Create your Integrated Application Form (PDF) with **[K-Visa Generator](https://k-form.kr)** and **book an appointment** at the Immigration Office.
4.  Visit a local **Public Health Center** for a TB test when you have time.
5.  Go to a **bank on campus** to open an account and get a check card.

Well begun is half done! If you solve these 5 things, 90% of your life in Korea is ready.
Don't get stressed by complicated paperwork and start enjoying your campus life! 🍀
