It's February, and everyone is busy preparing for the new semester. Have you checked the back of your **Alien Registration Card (ARC)**?
If the **Expiry Date is in March**, you need to hurry right now!

Since Korean universities start their semesters in March and September, **February and August are the 'Visa Extension War' periods** when immigration offices are paralyzed. If you apply late when everyone else is rushing, you might not get a reservation, and in the worst case, you could become an **illegal resident** and face a "fine bomb."

Today, we will perfectly summarize everything from **how to apply for complex student visa extensions to tips on getting a free pass without rejection.**

---

## 1. Why apply now (February)?

* **Deadline Approaching:** Student visas usually come in 1-year or 2-year blocks. Many students' visas expire in late March.
* **Grade/Graduation Variables:** If your GPA is below 2.0 or if you are postponing graduation, the visa review becomes stricter (e.g., only extending for 6 months), and you will need to prepare more documents.

---

## 2. How to extend? (2 Methods)

There are two main ways to extend your visa. Choose the method that suits your situation.

### ① Visit Application (Reservation Required)
* **Method:** Visit the jurisdictional Immigration Office in person and submit the documents.
* **Pros:** It is the most certain method as you meet the officer directly.
* **Cons:** **Booking a reservation is extremely difficult.** Especially in peak seasons like February, reservation slots are often full for weeks.

### ② Electronic Civil Service (HiKorea)
* **Method:** Scan and upload documents online (HiKorea).
* **Pros:** Very convenient as you don't have to visit the office.
* **Cons:** If documents are missing or incorrect, it is **mercilessly 'rejected' or a 'request for supplementation'** pops up.

### 💡 Important Fact!
**Whether you apply in person or online, filling out the [Integrated Application Form (Form No. 34)] is mandatory.**
Even for online applications, you must download the form, fill it out, scan it, and upload it.

## 3. 5 Essential Documents for Visa Extension (Checklist)

If any of the documents below are missing or the information is incorrect, the officer will send you back saying, "Please do it again."

### ✅ 1. Passport & Alien Registration Card (ARC)
* The most basic requirement.

### ✅ 2. Integrated Application Form (Form No. 34) 🌟 *Most Important!*
* **This is the document with the most mistakes.** Errors frequently occur in mixed Korean/English usage, address notation, and check boxes.
* If you write by hand and the handwriting is illegible, it may be rejected.

### ✅ 3. Certificate of Enrollment & Transcript
* They check not only if you are enrolled but also **if you studied faithfully (GPA)**. If your grades are bad, your visa extension may be refused.

### ✅ 4. Proof of Residence
* Very important because a wrong address can result in a fine.
* **Dormitory students:** Dormitory Residence Confirmation
* **Renters:** Lease Agreement in your name

### ✅ 5. Fee
* **60,000 KRW** (Revenue Stamp).

### ✅ 6. Proof of Finance (Only for applicable students)
* ① Low GPA (below 2.0) / ② Extra semester / Postponed graduation / Thesis preparation / ③ Low attendance rate
* (If your grades are good, you are exempt, so don't worry!)
* **Bank Balance Certificate:** Copy of bankbook and balance certificate in your or your parents' name (often requires history within the last 3 months).
* **Tuition Payment Certificate**
* **Scholarship Certificate:** If receiving a scholarship.
* **Family Relations Certificate:** Required if submitting parents' bank statements.

## 4. "Filling out the form is too complicated and anxious..." 🤯

"What if I write the wrong address and my visa extension gets rejected?"

So we created it. It is a **secret weapon to save your time and anxiety.**
