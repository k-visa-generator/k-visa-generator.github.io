Are you preparing to enter a university or graduate school in Korea? 🎓
As the admission season approaches, one of the most frequently asked questions we get is: **"Can I enter Korea early on a tourist visa, get accepted, and then switch to a D-2 student visa?"**

To give you the conclusion first: **It depends on your current visa status.** Under Korean immigration law, a 'Change of Status of Sojourn' within Korea is strictly regulated.

Check which of the following scenarios applies to you!

---

### ❌ Case 1: Entered on Visa-Free or Tourist Visa (B-1, B-2, C-3)

This is the most frequently asked question, but unfortunately, it is **Strictly Not Allowed**.

If you are currently staying in Korea on a short-term visa issued for tourism or visiting (or via K-ETA visa-free entry), you cannot change your status to a regular student visa (D-2) from within the country.

* **Solution (Visa Run):** You must leave Korea, apply for a new D-2 visa at the Korean embassy in your home country (or a third country like Japan), and re-enter Korea.

### ✅ Case 2: Holding a Language Trainee Visa (D-4)

This is the most standard and common route. **Change of status within Korea IS possible.**

If you have been studying Korean at a language institute on a D-4 visa and get accepted into a regular degree program (Bachelor's/Master's/Ph.D.), you do not need to return to your home country. You simply need to prepare documents like your certificate of admission and proof of finances, and apply for a 'Change of Status' at your local immigration office.

### ✅ Case 3: Holding an Exchange/Short-term Student Visa (D-2-8)

**Change of status within Korea IS possible.**

For example, you might have come to a Korean university as an exchange student for one semester (D-2-8), loved living here, and decided to proceed directly to a regular Master's program (D-2-3). In this case as well, you can extend and switch your visa through a change of status without leaving the country.

### ✅ Case 4: Holding a Job Seeker Visa (D-10)

What if you graduated from a Korean university, stayed on a D-10 (Job Seeking) visa to find a job, but then decided to go back for graduate school (Master's/Ph.D.)? **In this case, changing to a D-2 visa within Korea is also perfectly possible.**

### ⚠️ Important Notes for Change of Status

The most critical thing to remember when changing your visa status in Korea is that you must apply **"before your current visa expires."** Booking an appointment at the immigration office right before the semester starts is incredibly difficult, so you should prepare your documents at least 1-2 months in advance.

The most basic and essential document you will need is the immigration office's **[Integrated Application Form]**.

#### Feeling overwhelmed by the paperwork? 💡

The Integrated Application Form is packed with Korean and English text, and figuring out which boxes to check for a 'Change of Status' can be highly confusing. If you make a mistake while handwriting it, you have the hassle of starting all over again.

Stop writing it by hand! With **K-Visa Application Helper**, you can download a 100% official, perfectly filled-out Integrated Application Form PDF for free in just a few clicks.
